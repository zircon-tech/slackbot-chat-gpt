# Slackbot for GPT Chat

SlackBot Chat GPT is a language model app integrated into the Zircon's Slack workspace to enhance the team's communication and productivity. This SlackBot is designed to generate responses and engage in natural language conversations with users in the Slack channels, providing real-time assistance and automating tasks to streamline your workflow.

The bot is only configured to work properly in public and private channels but not in DMs or multi-person chats. It becomes easier when you want to post a question to a common group interest. Nonetheless, if you'd like to keep questions private, you can eventually create a private channel for yourself and ask there.

To trigger the bot, simply send `@Gpt Z` + *your question* in any private or public channel. The bot will take a few seconds and give you the answer you are looking for (hopefully) ðŸ˜Ž
